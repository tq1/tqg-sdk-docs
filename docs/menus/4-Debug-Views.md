The SDK provides two ViewControllers to be used by the app for debug purpose.

## Debug Map

The `DebugMapViewController` shows a map with the user's current location, the current zone and the fences inside this zone.

To use this view just create a new ViewController on your app and set its class to DebugMapViewController.


## Debug Log

The `LogViewController` shows the SDK log messages with filters. This is helpful for debugging. 

To use this views just create a new ViewController on your app and set its class to LogViewerViewController.
